# Musify

Melody generation using RNN-LSTM





## About the Project
* Platform : Visual Studio Code / Jupyter Notebook
* Language : Python 3.8
* Libraries Used : Tensorflow, Music21, Keras, NumPy, Sklearn, tqdm
* Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi
## File Structure
* All Midi Files/ : This is the dataset folder containing various midi files of different composers.
* code_musify.ipynb : In this file, we will build, train and test our model.
* MOD/ : This directory contains optimizer, metrics, and weights of our trained model.
* AI_music.mid : This is a music file of predicted notes.
* AI_music.mp3 : mp3 file conversion of AI_music.mid

## Work Flow
* Week 1 Brushing up basic python concepts
* Week 2 Started with reading relevant articles on music generation
* Week 3 Neural network and relevant concepts of deep learning
* Week 4 Started Learning Tensor flow
* Week 5 Tinkering with tensor flow and RNN LSTM
* Week 6 Implementation part started
* Week 7 model training and building
* Week 8 Submission documentation and repo
## Methodology
Follow the steps and compose music using AI

* STEP 1 : Download data files from repository
* STEP 3 : Open the given code file in google colab
* STEP 4 : Upload the All midi files folder in zip format to colab
* STEP 4 : Change the file path directories accordingly
* STEP 4 : Enable GPT computing from notebook setting in colab
* STEP 5 : Execute code and Wait for the model training
* STEP 6 : Run the last cell and a file named as AI_composed_music.mid will be saved
* STEP 7 : Play the file AI_composed_music.mid
